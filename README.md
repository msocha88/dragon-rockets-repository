Mission Summary Service
This project provides a backend component responsible for generating mission summaries based on current mission and team states. 
It processes real-time data using concurrent-safe collections and Java Streams for efficient filtering and transformation.

Key Features
- Stateless, functional service for computing mission summaries.

- Thread-safe and performant, built with ConcurrentHashMap and ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet() to handle concurrent access to state data.

- Modular and testable design with clear separation of concerns (input state, summary generation, etc.).

âœ… Tests
- Unit tests are written using JUnit 5 and AssertJ for fluent assertions. The test suite includes:

- Parameterized tests with dynamic input state (ConcurrentHashMap, Set) to ensure robustness.

- Verifications of business logic using extracting(...).containsExactly(tuple(...)) for clarity.

- // given, // when, // then structure for readability and maintainability.


ðŸ¤– AI-Assisted Code Review
This codebase has been reviewed and improved with the assistance of AI (ChatGPT by OpenAI) to ensure:

Clean, idiomatic Java practices.

Improved test readability and structure.

Enhanced edge-case handling and concurrency awareness.
